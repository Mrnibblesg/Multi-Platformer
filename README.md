# Multi-platformer

This game is going to turn into a cooperative platformer game.
I want it to have a theme, but don't currently have any ideas yet.

You can play with friends and strangers alike from anywhere you want.

Some features that I would like to add sometime in the future:

* The ability to create accounts
* The ability to party up with friends
* Achievements
* Advanced player movement mechanics complete with thorough tutorials
* A variety of different worlds, each complete with their own gimmicks
* So much more...

## Prerequisites

You must have Nodejs installed. Nodejs comes with npm, which is also required.
When Nodejs is installed, go to where the project will be located. Then,
go to your command line and type this command:

> npm install express

That will install [Express](https://expressjs.com).
After that is complete, we will install socket-io:

> npm install socket.io

Now that we have all our dependencies, you are free to start the server:

> node server.js

Then, all you have to do is connect to whatever machine is hosting the server and play!
